# International-Soccer-Results-Data-Analysis

This is my final project for a class I took called POLS 3316: Statistics for Political Science as part of my Data and Society minor. The class focused on Inferential Statistics and the R programming language. 

I used a dataset that contained all international soccer results from 1872 to the present to perform data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization, OLS Regressions, and Hypothesis Testing.
