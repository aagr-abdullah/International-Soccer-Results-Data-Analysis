# International-Soccer-Results-Data-Analysis

This is my final project for a class I took called POLS 3316: Statistics for Political Science as part of my Data and Society minor. I used a dataset on internationall soccer results to perform data cleaning, data analysis, and data visualization in R. Since the curriculum was based on inferential statistics, I also performed ols regression and three different hypothesis tests.
